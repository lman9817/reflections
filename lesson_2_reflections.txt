What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initialize creates a new git repository with no commits with the items located in the current directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows for placement of new items to be placed in the respository before being committed. They must reside within the working directory.
